# Presentation Evaluation

## What went well

The presentation clearly explained the purpose of API documentation and contract
validation for the Conference Room Booking System.

The use of OpenAPI, Swagger UI, and Postman demonstrated a strong understanding
of documentation-first API design and good engineering practices.

The presentation followed a clear structure and was appropriate for a technical
stakeholder audience.

## What was challenging

Explaining technical concepts while keeping within the time limit was challenging.

Presenting technical material required confidence and clear communication,
especially when discussing API contracts and validation tools.

## What I would improve next time

Next time, I would focus on:
- Speaking more clearly and confidently
- Practicing the presentation to reduce nerves
- Not letting nervousness affect how I explain technical concepts

Improving presentation confidence would help deliver the technical content
more effectively.

## Key takeaway

Clear API documentation and contract validation improve collaboration, reduce
integration errors, and provide a strong foundation for future development.
